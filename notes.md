## Challenges in applying the FAIR principles to software

## Blurb

    What software-related challenges exist in the transition towards Open Science? And how can research software help to expedite this process?

    The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) guiding principles were originally defined for data, but the same general principles could also be applied to research software. 

- But how to these principles help to make research software FAIR? 
- What problems will be solved by applying these principles to software? 

- highlight the role that research software plays in the scientific process 
- stimulate discussion on the topic of FAIR Software and the conditions for making research software FAIR.

### Challenges (Dan):
- Citability
- Availability
- Quality

# REQUIREMENTS 

- citation file format, 
- software sustainability 
- what can we do as RSEs?

21 November - 

Session 1 - FAIR Software

Summary
What software-related challenges exist in the transition towards Open Science? And how can research software help to expedite this process?

The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) guiding principles were originally defined for data, but the same general principles could also be applied to research software. But how to these principles help to make research software FAIR? What problems will be solved by applying these principles to software? This session will feature talks that highlight the role that research software plays in the scientific process and will stimulate discussion on the topic of FAIR Software and the conditions for making research software FAIR.
