# Is FAIR software fair enough?

# Spoiler: It's not.

# But: There's something great about FAIR!

## FAIR \<insert digital artifact class here\><br/>BETTER RESEARCH

[TODO: Reproducibility, etc.?]

. . .

::: {.large}

- FAIR makes research possible, easier, and better

:::

. . . 

::: {.large}

- FAIR doesn't obstruct Open Science (unlike Elsevier) [TODO: impede] 

:::

## FAIR, the brand

::: {.large}

- FAIR, FAIR, everywhere  
(it's almost as if ...)

:::

. . .

- Visibility for software sustainability concerns
- Policy changes create leverage (FAI**RSE** anyone?)

# Is FAIR enough?

## Dan Katz sez no! [@blog], [@slides]

. . .

::: {.center .large}

FAIR != OPEN [TODO: From Dan's blog]

:::

. . . 

::: {.center .large}

FAIR != CREDIT [There's no fair trade in FAIR, explain]

:::

. . .

::: {.center .large}

FAIR != GOOD [Quality TODO, concerns the functionality fo software, not the form (covered by FAIR)]

:::

## Perhaps we don't need "FAIR" for software, but rather rules of FAIR PLAY!

[TODO: Instead of trying to squeeze software into FAIR, we should extend FAIR to cover software]

::: {.large .center}

FAIR PLAY?<br/><span style="color:lightgray; font-size: 70%;">(I'm sure there's a backronym in there somewhere)</span>

:::

. . .

::: {.large}

FAIR PLAY Software is ...

**F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**eusable,<span class="fragment"><br/>and **P**er default open source,</span> <span class="fragment">therefore **L**iterally accessible,</span> <span class="fragment">**A**ttributing contributions for credit,</span> <span class="fragment">and of high qualit**Y**!</span>

# FAIR PLAY == RSEng! [TODO]

## RSEs be FAIR to the world

- Publicly funded research products (software) is for the public! [TODO link public money public code]
- Permissive open source licensing
- Publish your software proactively, and sustainably (Software Heritage)

## RSEs be FAIR to others

- Try to ensure that your software is of "high quality", so that other researchers can trust it.
- How to judge software quality (internal metrics, peer review, usage)
- Best practices: tests, docs, code review, etc.

## RSEs be FAIR to themselves

- Make your software citable (A in play)

## Okay, also be FAIR to others again

- Cite software that you use
- ... in your papers and your software

## "Haud on a buckin' minute here, Joe!<br/>Have ye noticed somethin?"

- Do you wanna make me do all the hard metadata work then?

[TODO Burnistoun]

Yea! But that's already what you should be doing according to good scientific principles.
As RSEs, we cannot pick the carrot and discard the stick, we're also obliged to stick to them,
we have all the advantages of interesting work with a high degree of freedom on avaerage,
but we also need to accept the disadvantages that come with it, i.e., academic rigour!

But we promsie to make it simpler.
Quality is your main concern anyway, right?
Accessibility as open source is your practice already, right?
So take citation!

# Case study: cite & make citable [TODO]

# Conclusion

## <s>FAIR Software</s> Practice of FAIR PLAY
